# How To Use
To add theme support for the Add-On Systems which you can install with this program, just copy the folder which belongs to your theme into the <strong>/roms/themes</strong> folder and you should be all good to go ðŸ˜Š.  
If your theme it's folder isn't listed here, then it (unfortunately) just means that your theme currently isn't supported by my program. This however doesn't mean it won't work, it just means that your theme will most likely just in a "boring way" will show the name of the Add-On system instead of for example showing a fancy logo and/or background image ðŸ˜Š.
  
NOTE: Theme support is very limited, but pull requests for other additional these are welcome (if they are made decently and without the chance of breaking the themes of course)ðŸ˜Š.
